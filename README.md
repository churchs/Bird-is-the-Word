# Bird-is-the-Word
 
Bird is the Word is a typing game made in about 16 hours for a Game Jam with a theme of "Birds" and a restriction of it never stopping, this was acheived by having the bird continously go on different 'sorties' while you type to increase the speed of each 'run'.


Reflections: This was a super fun experience I had with my wife over the course of a week during our free hours in the evening after our daughter went to bed for the night. I definitely overscoped myself on what I was wanting to get out of the game and ended up pulling things back in to get a finished product out. My organization skills were definitely challenged, and it was fun slashing together a quick working prototype of a typing game that has a karoake feel to it with the bouncing birds. I would love to come back and refactor this game one day, especially given my recent leaps in programming knowledge.
